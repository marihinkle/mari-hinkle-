Computers and how they work have never interested me, so other than sending an email, surfing and streaming the latest viral video, I know very little about how they do what they do. This self portrait assignment was so terrifying for me that I marched right into my academic advisor’s office to drop the class.  Needless to say, my request was denied and I needed to do something that is very hard for me to do….ask for help. I started with my inner circle; my teammates.  No one knew how to code html, so at least I felt LESS stupid.  If html was common knowledge and I was in the minority, I probably would have packed my bags and headed home.  After some self-reflection, I realized my pride was getting the best of me. 
I have been a volleyball player since I was nine years old.  I consider myself a perfectionist and I have never backed down from a challenge.  Up until now, all of my challenges have been sports related.  I would practice harder, watch more film and work my way to the next level. This was different. I had no idea where to begin. I thought about Ted Nelson’s dream in Computer Lib/Dream Machines.  He believed computers were for the masses. He wrote, “Everybody should understand computers” (Nelson 303) and that included me.  The creator of hypertext believed that “computers are an aspect of everything, and not to know this is computer illiteracy, a silly and dangerous ignorance” (Nelson, 303). The last thing I wanted to be called was illiterate and Ted Nelson didn’t think I should be illiterate either.  Therefore, HTML had to be relatively easy. Right? I just needed to dig in.  After a few tutorial videos and some tutoring from others, I was able to complete the assignment.  It’s not going to win any website design awards, but it’s done.
If I could create a webpage, anyone could do it. Anyone could publish their firsthand accounts of events, with photos and videos, for the world to examine.  One webpage at a time could be the way we create the world encyclopedia referred to by HG Wells in the World Brain: The Idea of a Permanent Encyclopedia.  Access to information would no longer be restricted. “This in itself is a fact of tremendous significance. It foreshadows a real intellectual unification of our race. The whole human memory can be, and probably in a short time will be made accessible to every individual” (Wells, 2). The power of knowledge will be made available to all through the internet and through the ideas of all the visionaries we have read about to date.  I’m grateful for the experience of learning to use HTML. It’s empowering to know that if I needed to share my story with the world, I would have a way to do it.

# Week Two Blog Post 

There have been so many times in my life where I have sat down at the computer to research something and hours later I’m watching a video about a Beetle in Africa or something.  This week I learned that internet search engines where designed that way and like most amazing inventions, it was developed out of frustration.  In the first Week #2 reading, As We May Think, Vannevar Bush was writing to encourage the scientific community to continue sharing the vast amount of knowledge that was learned during World War II.  During the war, “the scientist, burying their old professional competition in the demand of a common cause, shared greatly and learned much.” (Bush 2) Bush wanted the scientists to continue advancing technology through shared research and did not want to go back to hoarding knowledge.  In 1945, Bush wrote “The world has arrived at an age of cheap complex devices of great reliability; and something is bound to come of it” (Bush 3). He seemed to be envisioning that one of these machines could be the record where information could be shared.  He wanted “a record, if it is to be useful to science, must be continuously extended, it must be stored, and above all it must be consulted” (Bush 3). In this article, Bush was envisioning the first network computer system.  He imagined on top of a desk, “slanting translucent screens, on which material can be projected for convenient reading. There is a keyboard, and sets of buttons and levers” (Bush 10).  Was Bush the first person to image the personal computer?  He even went a step further to suggest that sometime in the future, information could be transmitted directly to the brain!  What must have sounded like a hallucinogenic fantasy in 1945 and it may actually happen soon. 

The last three readings of week #2, gave me an understanding on the thought processes involved in designing the search interfaces for organizing, searching, finding and sharing vast amounts of information. The author of Information Management: A Proposal”, Berners-Lee was frustrated with the amount of information that was being lost at CERN simply because one couldn’t find it.  Berners-Lee as well as Marcia Bates, the author of the article, The Design of Browsing and Berrypicking Techniques for the Online Search Interface both argued for Hypertext to be used in the design of their search programs. Hypertext was first coined by Ted Nelson, in 1965.  This was 25 years before these articles.  Nelson explained hypertext “to mean a body of written or pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that it could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper” (Wardrip-Fruin 2).  At the time when Nelson wrote about Hypertext as the network interface of the future and how it would transform everyone’s lives, he was laughed at and ridiculed.
	
In the second week #2 article, From Computer Lib/Dream Machines, I read about Ted Nelson’s dreams and visions for the computer to become personal. I take for granted the computer I carry in my hand every day.  I didn’t realize that to bring the computer to the masses, people would have to rebel against the establishment and fight the power of large corporations and government to make it happen. On a personal note, I wish his ideas on transforming education would happen.  I took an online class in high school and it was the most boring class ever.  It was entirely Computer Aided Instruction and it did everything Nelson said it would… [It removed opportunity for initiative and creativity and was conducive to boredom] (Nelson 311).  Maybe his proposal was too threatening to the establishment more than Hypertext, therefore, it will take longer to come to fruition.  I too would like to “discard the sequences, items and conversation, and allow the student to move freely through materials which he may control. Motivate the user and let him loose in a wonderful place“ (Nelson 313).  That is exactly what happens on those browsing excursions that start with me checking the weather and ending up reading an article on the shifting of the magnetic poles. It’s the hypertext that puts the world’s knowledge in the palm of my hand and I’m glad that Ted Nelson got the last laugh.

# Week One Blog Post 

To be honest, the thought of how the internet was created or how it has impacted society never entered my mind. It is something I use every day without considering how it has impacted the way I communicate and form relationships with others. The first reading Technology and Ideology: The Case of the Telegraph, changed my understanding of the telegraph completely. I never realized the impact it had on society by completely changing the way people communicated. As the article stated, “It permitted for the first time the effective separation of communication from transportation” (Carey 3). For the first time in history, people did not have to communicate face to face or rely on transportation to deliver their messages. It developed new forms of language, particularly shortening the amount of words for communication and removing much of the prose seen in letter writing. The telegraph clearly was the precursor to the internet. The internet expanded the principles of the telegraph where communication was separate from geography, to one where communication was separated from the infrastructure use to send it (Esperanto for Machines 198) .
					
With the examples of new technologies in the reading, The Master Switch, I found it interesting how each new technology went through a cycle which resulted in a “highly centralized and integrated new industry” (Wu 6). Each industry passed through the phases of “somebody’s hobby to somebody’s industry; from freely accessible channel to one strictly controlled by a single corporation or cartel – from and open to closed system” (Wu 6). That which was first intended to free society from some constraint, like geography, usually ended with the people controlled by the monopoly that owned the technology. It is important that this never happens to the internet, but I’m concerned that regulation by governments or the ability of the larger companies like Google and Facebook to control who has access to information may make the internet less free.
					
In the reading Engineering a Principle “: End-to End” in the Design of the Internet, the author talks about “end to end” being a phrase used by the developers not only to describe the structure of the network, but as a metaphor that the power is in the user should not be controlled by one entity. I agree that the internet should be a fully free exchange of information. The one who controls what information we receive, controls the world. I like how what was a phrase to describe the technology as morphed into a political rallying cry....“the Internet is end-to-end, until someone makes it otherwise" (Gillespie 443). I’m relieved to know that people have already developed low tech solutions to building the internet. Those described in the reading How to Build a Low Tech Internet will allow the internet to survive “if the fuel supply is interrupted, the electrical infrastructure deteriorates, when the economy grinds to a halt, or if other calamities should hit” (De Decker, 3). I find it comforting to know that if some doomsday scenario should occurs, the internet and the free flow of information will continue. We don’t need to rely on governments or companies, we can build our own communication networks.
