To be honest, the thought of how the internet was created or how it has impacted society never entered my mind. It is something I use every day without considering how it has impacted the way I communicate and form relationships with others. The first reading Technology and Ideology: The Case of the Telegraph, changed my understanding of the telegraph completely. I never realized the impact it had on society by completely changing the way people communicated. As the article stated, “It permitted for the first time the effective separation of communication from transportation”. (Carey James 3). For the first time in history, people did not have to communicate face to face or rely on transportation to deliver their messages. It developed new forms of language, particularly shortening the amount of words for communication and removing much of the prose seen in letter writing. The telegraph clearly was the precursor to the internet. The internet expanded the principles of the telegraph where communication was separate from geography, to one where communication was separated from the infrastructure use to send it. (Esperanto for Machines 198) .
					
With the examples of new technologies in the reading, The Master Switch, I found it interesting how each new technology went through a cycle which resulted in a “highly centralized and integrated new industry”. (Wu, Tim 6) Each industry passed through the phases of “somebody’s hobby to somebody’s industry; from freely accessible channel to one strictly controlled by a single corporation or cartel – from and open to closed system.” (Wu, Tim 6). That which was first intended to free society from some constraint, like geography, usually ended with the people controlled by the monopoly that owned the technology. It is important that this never happens to the internet, but I’m concerned that regulation by governments or the ability of the larger companies like Google and Facebook to control who has access to information may make the internet less free.
					
In the reading Engineering a Principle “: End-to End” in the Design of the Internet, the author talks about “end to end” being a phrase used by the developers not only to describe the structure of the network, but as a metaphor that the power is in the user should not be controlled by one entity. I agree that the internet should be a fully free exchange of information. The one who controls what information we receive, controls the world. I like how what was a phrase to describe the technology as morphed into a political rallying cry....“the Internet is end-to-end, until someone makes it otherwise.’ (Gillespie, Tarleton 443). I’m relieved to know that people have already developed low tech solutions to building the internet. Those described in the reading How to Build a Low Tech Internet will allow the internet to survive “if the fuel supply is interrupted, the electrical infrastructure deteriorates, when the economy grinds to a halt, or if other calamities should hit”. I find it comforting to know that if some doomsday scenario should occurs, the internet and the free flow of information will continue. We don’t need to rely on governments or companies, we can build our own communication networks.
